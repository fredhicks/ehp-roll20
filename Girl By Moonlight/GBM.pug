// How are them rolls handled?
//
// Characters
// Action roll - playbook-stats.pug
// Fortune roll - playbook-other-rolls.pug
// Resistance roll - playbook-stats.pug
// Downtime roll - page 84 - added a reference bloc for how to handle the results 
// Eclipse roll - playbook-stress.pug
// Obligation roll - playbook-other-rolls.pug
// Recovery roll - page 70 - default, a FRIEND helps you recover during downtime - mainly needs documentation
// 
// Missions
// Engagement roll - page 90 - Is its own thing but it's a kind of fortune roll
// Fallout roll - page 98 - sounds like something only the Director (GM) rolls
