	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Otherworldly Intuition:</b> When you encounter something from another world, you recognise that they don’t belong here. When you encounter a place where another world is accessible, you are aware of it and may stop at the threshold.','share')
	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Wardens:</b> Once per mystery while you’re defending a portal, wall, or border, you may ignore all harm from a single source, or treat a roll as if you rolled a 12. This works just as if you spent a Luck, except it doesn’t trigger your special move.','share')
	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Outer Speech:</b> You have a knack for the languages of the multiverse. You can always understand, and make yourself understood, when you’re talking to denizens from beyond. This is mainly the general sense of things—some details might get lost along the way.','share')
	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Walkers between Worlds:</b> At a suitable liminal site, you know how to step between worlds. Describe how you open the way and roll +Weird. On a 10+, you’re walking to the place you intended, but the way may be difficult. On a 7–9, choose one: you’re on the right path in immediate danger, or you find yourself lost and in the wrong place. On a 6 or less, you’re lost and in big trouble. If more than one of the hunters is using this move together, only make one roll: the hunter with the worst Weird score rolls (but they may accept help).','share')
	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Outsider Knack:</b> Once per visit to another world, you may use a trick or ability from Earth to gain an advantage. The advantage allows you to roll one move using three dice, selecting the best two for your result.','share')
	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Something Different:</b> Take a move from another team playbook.','share')
	+move('Guardians-Move','<b>Change Team Style:</b> Pick a new team style. You now use that one instead of the one you first chose.','share')
