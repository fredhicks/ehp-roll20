	+move('League-Move','<b>Big Reveal:</b> If most people around you don’t know about your secret identities, the first action you take in that scene that reveals those identities gets +1 forward. Bystanders and minions present freeze in surprise for a moment, giving you an opportunity to act before they can react.','share')
	+move('League-Move','<b>Affluent:</b> You can get most gear easily. Specify what you need, assigning tags to the gear. If it’s a weapon, treat each harm beyond 2-harm as a separate tag; if it’s armour, treat each point of armour as a separate tag. Then roll +tags. On a miss, you get it easily. On a 7–9, you get it but raise some questions. On a 10+, either you don’t get it or you do but someone gets a clear clue about your secret identity.','share')
	+move('League-Move','<b>Only When Necessary:</b> If you manage to stop or destroy a minion without using any abilities or gear of your secret identity (including monster hunting weapons), each hunter involved marks experience. If it was a monster, mark two.','share')
	+move('League-Move','<b>Shadow Selves:</b> When one of you wants to be in two places at the same time, summon your shadow self in another place. Only one shadow self can per hunter exist at one time. The shadow self has a trait that allows others to distinguish it from you if they observe closely. Roll +Weird. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend holds to have your shadow self act as if it were you, but with –1 ongoing. When you spend the last hold, the shadow self dissolves in an obviously supernatural and unsettling way. On a miss, the shadow self appears for a moment and does something you really, really didn’t want them to do...','share')
