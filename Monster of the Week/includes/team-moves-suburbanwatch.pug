	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Earned Trust:</b> People in your community know you, and know you mean well. They’ll generally believe what you tell them. If you ask them to do something for their own safety, they usually go along with it.','share')
	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Familiarity:</b> When you’re checking out something in your community, you’ll always recognise right away if something has changed in an out-of-the-ordinary way. You can pick up things like a house suddenly quiet, a new tree in the park, or a stranger working at the corner store.','share')
	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Domestic Wardings:</b> You know how to protect houses from evil supernatural influences. All your homes are warded, and you may ward others too. It’s a <b>big magic</b> ritual requiring 24 hours, all the hunters, and a number of protective items that must be placed around the house. The wardings might be broken eventually by a concerted attack.','share')
	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Backyard Allies:</b> You’ve made friends with some feral or wild animals that are smarter than normal—perhaps modern nature spirits? In any case, they can scout and spy for you, and it’s unlikely anyone will pay attention to them. They might ask you for favours too, now and then.','share')
	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Craft Circle:</b> Whenever you need a physical item as a magical requirement, you can craft a substitute together. All the hunters must take part, and you’ll need a few hours. You can replace one requirement per spell this way.','share')
	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Something Different:</b> Take a move from another team playbook.','share')
	+move('SuburbanWatch-Move','<b>Change Team Style:</b> Pick a new team style. You now use that one instead of the one you first chose.','share')
