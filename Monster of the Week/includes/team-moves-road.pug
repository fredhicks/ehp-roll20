	+move('Road-Team-Move','<b>Home Away from Home:</b> Whenever you arrive in a new town, you immediately find a motel and a cafe that are friendly and welcoming. One or the other will turn out to have a connection to the mystery that brought you here, even if just by having a bystander come by.','share')
	+move('Road-Team-Move','<b>Geniality:</b> When you meet a new person in a town you haven’t visited before, roll +Charm. On a 10+, they are well-disposed towards you. On a 7–9, they’re still well-disposed but the Keeper chooses one: they are marked for trouble, or they conceal something from the hunters. Additionally, when you return to a town you have already visited, you always run into the people you befriended previously.','share')
	+move('Road-Team-Move','<b>Handy:</b> You’re all good at fixing stuff. Anything broken or messed up in the course of a mystery is repaired and ready to go before the next one. Gear or assets that would be described as “totally destroyed” still need to be replaced.','share')
	+move('Road-Team-Move','<b>No-stick:</b> You’ve had yourselves removed from official and law enforcement databases. You don’t have to worry about “misunderstandings” from previous towns getting in the way of your hunts (unless someone got annoyed enough to make it a personal vendetta).','share')
	+move('Road-Team-Move','<b>Monster Journals:</b> When a mystery reminds you of something you encountered before, consult your notes and tell the Keeper what you think is the same. The Keeper will say if you got it right. If you’re correct, take +1 forward to <b>investigate a mystery</b>. If you’re wrong but had a good idea, take +1 forward to <b>read a bad situation</b>. If you’re totally off base, the Keeper holds 1 to put you in a tight spot.','share')
