DONE 

- Added Codex of Worlds world-setting selection and non-lethal weapons on/off to the pre-launch game options.
- Support for Gothic Century, Monster Marches, Dreaming With the Gods, and Bone Spear modifications to the moves, gear, and other playbook features as indicated by Codex of Worlds. Includes the Bone Spear specific reskinning of several playbooks.

- Added list of special materials available for weapons to all character gear listings for games set in the Monster Marches.

- Added support for the Villain threat type from Monster Marches to the Mystery Sheet.
- Added Dive into Dreams basic move support for Dreaming With the Gods setting from Codex of Worlds. Will show up in the hunter's reference when the Dreaming With the Gods setting is selected in game options.
- Added a "Mark of the Spirit-Touched" field to the character Look block which is activated only for Monster Marches.

- Added support for changing Luck to Ancestral Favour in Bone Spear.
- Added support for the different features of mysteries, monsters, phenomena, bystanders, locations, and minions for Bone Spear to the Keeper's mystery sheet.

- Fixed CSS for dark mode display of some annotations that appear on some rolltemplate outputs.



GITHUB UPDATE for phase one (Team Playbooks)

Major: Adding in support for using a character sheet for all of the Team Playbooks (you/the GM would make this visible and alterable by the playgroup, rather than one individual player; has enough complexity and persistence-need that it doesn’t make sense as a map object, so def squarely in the character sheet space) 

Very minor: Adding support to the mystery/monster builder sheet for the new Atonement Mystery type — but that’s mainly “replace Monster Weakness with Sin or Wrongdoing [to be resolved]”

Minor: Non-Lethal Play chapter is mainly guidelines for how to change your tempo on healing; page 23 does have a “Gear” section which is a list of stuff that the GM can “allow the players to swap for any of their existing gear picks”, so maybe a toggle for “provide non-lethal gear options” that makes those appear in any playbook’s pickable gear list.

- NULL OPERATION: This Strange Old House is the smallest World in the Codex, and does not actually require any changes to how character playbooks work, so that’s potentially fruitful. The only particularly unusual asset with House is the exploration map, but that would best be handled as an in-module/on-VTT-table thing rather than any sheet integration being necessary.
